### 000 - Sum comparison:

Compares the solution obtained by GA with the best solution obtained by NSGA for every pair (repetition, student)


### 001 - Dominance comparison:

Compares how many solution obtained by NSGA are dominated by the solution obtained by GA for every pair (repetition, student)


### 002 - Dominance all objectives:

Compares how many solution obtained by NSGA are dominated by the solution obtained by GA for every pair (repetition, student) considering all objectives
